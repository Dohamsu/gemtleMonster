description: 32x32 크기의 픽셀 아트 이미지를 생성합니다.
---

Create a high-quality 32x32 pixel art image.
Transparent background (PNG).

Classic 16-bit (SNES-era) pixel art style.
Clean, well-defined square pixels with sharp edges.
No vector lines, no smoothing.

Richer and more detailed than 8-bit,
with controlled pixel-based shading and depth.
Use pixel clusters to create form and material,
but keep everything stylized and abstract.

Expanded but limited color palette (12–20 colors).
Subtle pixel-level shading allowed.
No gradients, no blur, no glow, no bloom.

Strong silhouette and clear pixel structure.
Readable at true 1x 32x32 scale.
Designed for retro RPG-style UI and sprites.

Do NOT use illustration or painting styles.
Do NOT use anime, cartoon, or chibi styles.
Do NOT use 3D rendering, vector art, or high-resolution illustration.
Do NOT use soft lighting, smooth gradients, or post-processing effects.
